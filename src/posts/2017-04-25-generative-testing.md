title: Generative Testing
description: A real-world example (generating valid GraphQL schemas in ClojureScript).
---

In this post, we're going to walk through building a generator for valid
GraphQL schemas specified in
<a href="http://graphql.org/learn/schema/#type-language" target="_blank">GraphQL Shema Language</a>
(sans _Arguments_). We will take a bottom-up approach starting with
primitive generators, composing these into higher-level generators,
and those into yet higher-level generators, and so on (à la
_Stratified Design_[^1]), building our way
up to the final goal: a single simple generator that provides a unique
valid GraphQL schema each time it is sampled. Along the way, we will pause
to make sure that each primitive or composition of primitives
produces correct values.

<a href="/resources/generators.cljs">Download Full Source</a>

First, let's require test.check.
```clojure
cljs.user=> (require '[clojure.test.check.generators :as gen :include-macros true])
true
```

Now we can begin defining our primitive generators. For the typenames for
our object types let's use the capital letters: A-Z. `gen/elements` takes a
collection of values and produces a generator that randomly chooses an
element from the collection:
```clojure
cljs.user=> (def a-to-z-gen (gen/elements (map char (range 65 (+ 65 26)))))
#'cljs.user/a-to-z-gen
```

To convince ourselves that this is working, let's try sampling a few items
using the function `gen/sample`. `gen/sample` takes two arguments: a generator
and a number of samples to generate. (There is also a single-arity version
which generates 10 samples by default).
```clojure
cljs.user=> (gen/sample a-to-z-gen 5)
("K" "M" "W" "G" "S")
```

Now that we can generate individual typenames for our objects, let's build
a generator that will produce a set of typenames given the first generator.
Each of these sets will eventually specify the names of the types comprising
an individual schema.
```clojure
cljs.user=> (def entity-set-gen (gen/set a-to-z-gen {:min-elements 8 :max-elements 25}))
#'cljs.user/entity-set-gen
```

`gen/set` conveniently accepts `min-elements` and `max-elements` which let
us put bounds on the sizes of the generated sets.

Sampling a few of these gives:
```clojure
cljs.user=> (sample-one entity-set-gen)
#{"K" "Q" "L" "G" "J" "M" "S" "Y" "H" "C" "B" "V" "U" "A" "W"}
cljs.user=> (sample-one entity-set-gen)
#{"T" "Q" "J" "M" "S" "Y" "E" "F" "A" "I" "D"}
cljs.user=> (sample-one entity-set-gen)
#{"Q" "J" "S" "Y" "C" "B" "V" "U" "O" "N" "I"}
```
(`sample-one` is a helper simplifying the sampling of one element.)
```clojure
cljs.user=> (defn sample-one [generator] (first (gen/sample generator 1)))
#'cljs.user/sample-one
```

With a generator for complete sets of typenames for our schemas in hand,
let us proceed to composing it with a generator of unique pairs of
relations between the types/entities. Two types will be considered
related if at least one of the types has a field of the type of the
other type in the relation (although the relation may be bidirectional/mutual
and in the case where the relation is merely unidirectional, multiple
fields may participate in the relation).[^2] We will consider these restrictions
more closely as we proceed but, for now, it is enough to consider these two
fairly obvious (basic) requirements: no relation may be repeated and relations
are unordered; i.e., `[A B]` is the same as `[B A]`.

First, let's define `relation-gen`:
```clojure
cljs.user=> (defn relation-gen [entity-set]
              (gen/list-distinct (gen/elements entity-set) {:num-elements 2}))
#'cljs.user/relation-gen
```

And sample it a few times:
```clojure
cljs.user=> (sample-one (relation-gen #{"A" "B" "C" "D"}))
("C" "D")
cljs.user=> (sample-one (relation-gen #{"A" "B" "C" "D"}))
("C" "A")
cljs.user=> (sample-one (relation-gen #{"A" "B" "C" "D"}))
("A" "D")
```

And then combine it with `entity-set-gen`:
```clojure
cljs.user=>
(def entities-and-relations-gen
  (gen/let [entity-set entity-set-gen
            relations (gen/list-distinct-by set (relation-gen entity-set)
                       {:min-elements (int (* (count entity-set) (/ 2 3)))
                        :max-elements (int (* (count entity-set) 3))})]
    {:entities entity-set :relations relations}))
#'cljs.user/entities-and-relations-gen
```

The above form utilizes `gen/let` which has equivalent semantics to built-in
`let` except that generators are required on the right-hand side of the binding
vector and the symbols on the left are bound to *values* generated by those
generators. Also of note here is the use of `list-distinct-by` which is 
just like `list-distinct` except allowing a transform to be specified for
use in the equality checks (which in our case is `set`).

Let's take a sample from this latest generator:
```clojure
cljs.user=> (pprint (sample-one entities-and-relations-gen))
{:entities #{"T" "L" "Y" "F" "P" "O" "N" "W" "D"},
 :relations
 (("W" "T")
  ("Y" "N")
  ("P" "O")
  ("L" "T") 
  ("F" "N") 
  ("T" "N") 
  ("O" "F") 
  ("Y" "L") 
  ("D" "T"))}
```

Each side of a relation may have a multiplicity of zero, one or many so let's
define a data structure representing these:
```clojure
cljs.user=> (def multiplicities #{:zero :one :many})
#'cljs.user/multiplicities 
```

And a generator for them:
```clojure
cljs.user=> (def multiplicity-gen (gen/elements multiplicities))
#'cljs.user/multiplicity-gen
```

Also we will require a non-zero multiplicity generator (i.e., either `:one`
or `:many`):
```clojure
cljs.user=> (require '[clojure.set])
nil
cljs.user=> (def non-zero-mult-gen (gen/elements (clojure.set/difference multiplicities #{:zero})))
#'cljs.user/non-zero-mult-gen
```

These work as expected:
```clojure
cljs.user=> (assert (every? #(multiplicities %) (gen/sample multiplicity-gen 10000)))
nil
cljs.user=> (assert (every? #(#{:one :many} %) (gen/sample non-zero-mult-gen 10000)))
nil
```

Now we will define a `Cardinality` as two `Multiplicities` (one for each side of a relation):
```clojure
cljs.user=> (defrecord Multiplicity [entity field multiplicity required?])
cljs.user/Multiplicity
cljs.user=> (defrecord Cardinality [left right])
cljs.user/Cardinality
```

Here is a wrapper around `goog.string/format` which we will use for string building:
```clojure
cljs.user=> (require '[goog.string.format])
true
cljs.user=> 
(defn format
  "Formats a string using goog.string.format."
  [fmt & args]
  (apply goog.string/format fmt args))
#'cljs.user/format
```

And a function that produces generators of `Cardinalities` from relations:
```clojure
cljs.user=> (require '[clojure.string :refer [lower-case]])
nil
cljs.user=> 
(defn relation->cardinalities-gen [[left right]]
  (gen/let [lmult multiplicity-gen
            repeats (gen/choose 1 5)]
    (let [create-card
          #(Cardinality.
            (Multiplicity. left (lower-case right)
                           lmult (sample-one gen/boolean))
            (Multiplicity. right %1 (sample-one non-zero-mult-gen)
                           (sample-one gen/boolean)))]
      (condp = lmult
        :zero (map
               create-card
               (map #(format "%s%s" (lower-case left) %1) (range repeats)))
        [(create-card (lower-case left))]))))
#'cljs.user/relation->cardinalities-gen
```

Let's break that down a bit. First off, we generate a multiplicity for the left
side of the relation and a number of repeats (which will only be used if the left
side has a `:zero` participation). Then we define a simple helper function for
constructing a cardinality: `create-card`. Notice that the field names are merely
the destination type names, lower-cased, and optionally with a unique integer index
postpended (for multiple-link relations only). And the right side's multiplicity comes
from the `non-zero-mult-gen` (which simplifies downstream logic by reducing the number
of cases we need to consider). Then, in both branches of the `condp` (i.e., when left
multiplicity is zero or non-zero), a sequence of `Cardinality` instances is generated.

Next up we have a fairly straightforward generator to combine our entities, relations
& cardinalities into a single structure:
```clojure
cljs.user=> 
(def entities-and-cardinalities-gen
  (gen/let [{:keys [entities relations]} entities-and-relations-gen
            cardinalities (apply gen/tuple (map relation->cardinalities-gen relations))]
    {:entities entities :relations relations :cardinalities (flatten cardinalities)}))
#'cljs.user/entities-and-cardinalities-gen 
```

And here's an abbreviated sample of its output:
```clojure
{:entities
 #{"T" "Q" "L" "G" "J" "M" "S" "Z" "H" "R" "C" "F" "B" "V" "O" "X" "N"
   "A" "I" "W" "D"},
 :relations
 (("J" "B") ("N" "I") ("Z" "G") ("H" "R") ("Z" "V") ("G" "V") ...)
 :cardinalities
  ({:left
   {:entity "J", :field "b", :multiplicity :zero, :required? true},
   :right
   {:entity "B", :field "j0", :multiplicity :many, :required? true}}
  {:left
   {:entity "N", :field "i", :multiplicity :zero, :required? false},
   :right
   {:entity "I", :field "n0", :multiplicity :one, :required? false}}
  {:left
   {:entity "Z", :field "g", :multiplicity :zero, :required? false},
   :right
   {:entity "G", :field "z0", :multiplicity :one, :required? true}}
   {:left
   {:entity "J", :field "l", :multiplicity :one, :required? true},
   :right
   {:entity "L", :field "j", :multiplicity :many, :required? true}}
  {:left
   {:entity "H", :field "a", :multiplicity :many, :required? true},
   :right
   {:entity "A", :field "h", :multiplicity :one, :required? false}}
   ...)}
```

Now let's define a record to represent the description of a
field in a GraphQL entity specification:
```clojure
cljs.user=> (defrecord FieldDescriptor [field type multiplicity required?])
cljs.user/FieldDescriptor
```

And a generator for a plain (i.e., scalar or non-object/non-reference)
field descriptor:
```clojure
cljs.user=> (require '[camel-snake-kebab.core :refer [->camelCase ->PascalCase]])
true
cljs.user=> (def scalar-types #{"Boolean" "String" "Float" "Timestamp" "Int"})
#'cljs.user/scalar-types
cljs.user=> 
(defn field-gen [prefix]
  (let [nonempty-char-alpha-gen
        (gen/not-empty (gen/fmap clojure.string/join
                                 (gen/vector gen/char-alpha)))]
    (gen/fmap (partial apply ->FieldDescriptor)
              (gen/tuple (gen/fmap #(format "%s%s" prefix (->PascalCase %1))
                                  nonempty-char-alpha-gen)
                        (gen/elements scalar-types)
                        non-zero-mult-gen
                        gen/boolean))))
#'cljs.user/field-gen 
```

And take a few samples[^3]:
```clojure
cljs.user=> (sample-one (field-gen "test"))
#cljs.user.FieldDescriptor{:field "testQk", :type "Boolean", :multiplicity :many, :required? true}
cljs.user=> (sample-one (field-gen "test"))
#cljs.user.FieldDescriptor{:field "testH", :type "Timestamp", :multiplicity :one, :required? true}
cljs.user=> (sample-one (field-gen "test"))
#cljs.user.FieldDescriptor{:field "testE", :type "Int", :multiplicity :one, :required? false}
```

Next we will define a generator for object fields:
```clojure
cljs.user=> 
(defn cardinality->obj-field-descriptor [entity cardinality]
  (let [grouped (group-by #(-> (%1 1) :entity) cardinality)
        this (first (vals (into {} (grouped entity))))
        other-entity (:entity ((((first (dissoc grouped entity)) 1) 0) 1))]
    (if (not= :zero (:multiplicity this))
      (FieldDescriptor. (:field this) other-entity (:multiplicity this) (:required? this)))))
#'cljs.user/cardinality->obj-field-descriptor
```

And then combine them together to describe complete entities:
```clojure
cljs.user=> 
(defn entity->cardinalities [entity cardinalities]
  (filter #(or (= entity (-> %1 :left :entity)) (= entity (-> %1 :right :entity))) cardinalities))
#'cljs.user/entity->cardinalities
cljs.user=> 
(defn entity->descriptors-gen [entity cardinalities]
  (let [filtered (entity->cardinalities entity cardinalities) ; Note: O(n^2), can be optimized
        obj-fields (remove nil? (map (partial cardinality->obj-field-descriptor entity) filtered))
        default-field (FieldDescriptor. "id" "ID" :one true)]
    (gen/let [num-fields (gen/choose 2 8)
              plain-fields (apply gen/tuple (repeat num-fields (field-gen (->camelCase entity))))]
      {:entity entity :fields (concat [default-field] plain-fields obj-fields)})))
#'cljs.user/entity->descriptors-gen
cljs.user=> 
(def entity-descriptors-gen
  (gen/let [{:keys [entities relations cardinalities]} entities-and-cardinalities-gen
            entity-descriptors (apply gen/tuple (map #(entity->descriptors-gen %1 cardinalities) entities))]
    entity-descriptors))
#'cljs.user/entity-descriptors-gen
```

And sampling one complete entity gives:
```clojure
cljs.user=> (pprint (-> (sample-one entity-descriptors-gen) first))
{:entity "K",
 :fields
 ({:field "id", :type "ID", :multiplicity :one, :required? true}
  {:field "kB", :type "Int", :multiplicity :many, :required? false}
  {:field "kO", :type "String", :multiplicity :one, :required? true}
  {:field "u", :type "U", :multiplicity :many, :required? true}
  {:field "r", :type "R", :multiplicity :one, :required? true})}
```

Now all that is left is to emit the GraphQL Schema Language given
an entity description record:
```
cljs.user=> 
(defn emit-field [fd]
  (if (#{:one :many} (:multiplicity fd))
    (format "%s: %s%s%s%s"
            (:field fd)
            (if (= (:multiplicity fd) :many) "[" "")
            (:type fd)
            (if (= (:multiplicity fd) :many) "]" "")
            (if (:required? fd) "!" "")) nil))
#'cljs.user/emit-field
cljs.user=> 
(defn emit-type [{:keys [entity fields]}]
  (format "type %s {\n%s\n}"
          entity
          (clojure.string/join "\n" (remove nil? (map emit-field fields)))))
#'cljs.user/emit-type
```

And join a sequence of them together into the full schema:
```
cljs.user=> 
(def schema-str-gen
  (gen/let [entity-descriptors entity-descriptors-gen]
    (clojure.string/join "\n\n" (map emit-type entity-descriptors))))
#'cljs.user/schema-str-gen
```

And the final product:
```
cljs.user=> (print (sample-one schema-str-gen))
type H {
  id: ID!
  hX: [Boolean]!
  hY: Int!
  hL: Boolean
  hO: [String]!
  x: X
  r: R
  m: [M]
  y: [Y]!
}

type Y {
  id: ID!
  yUk: [Boolean]!
  yI: [Timestamp]
  yA: Int!
  q: Q
  h: H
}
...
```

[^2]: These restrictions are placed on us by the library this was originally designed to test,
    <a href="https://johanatan.github.io/speako/" target="_blah">speako</a>, which does not support
non-standard extensions to the, as of yet informally specified, GraphQL Schema Language.
Yet even with these restrictions speako is quite usuable/flexible in practice and there
are straightforward workarounds for obtaining multiple bidirectional relations between two
entities if one absolutely requires them. Arguably the benefit of keeping the GQL Schema
Language syntax simpler (and more portable to other GQL backends) is well worth the tradeoff
of slightly more restrictions on the nature of relations.
[^3]: `field-gen` takes a prefix so that we can ensure that each set of fields generated
for our entities is unique (which is a requirement of speako).
